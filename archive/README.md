# üóÑÔ∏è Archive Folder

This folder contains files that have been archived during the repository reorganization on **October 10, 2025**.

## üì¶ Archive Contents

### **deprecated-approaches/**
- **Old load testing methods** that have been replaced by better approaches
- `Update-LoadTestFunction.ps1` - Azure Functions approach (replaced by Azure Container Instances)
- `Monitor-LoadTest.ps1` - Old monitoring script (replaced by Monitor-LoadGenerator-Resilient.ps1)

### **experimental/**
- **Experimental scripts** that were tested but not adopted
- `Test-PostgreSQL-Failover.csx` - C# version of failover test (PowerShell version is current)

### **development/**
- **Development utilities** used during active development
- `Test-LoadGenerator-Local.ps1` - Local load generator testing utility

### **duplicates/**
- **Duplicate files** that existed in multiple locations
- `LoadGenerator.csx` - Root copy (canonical version is in `/scripts/`)

### **generated-outputs/**
- **Generated dashboard files** from monitoring tools
- PostgreSQL dashboard JSON files (timestamps: 20251010-203953, 20251010-204421)
- KQL monitoring queries (generated by Create-PostgreSQL-Dashboard.ps1)
- **Note:** Azure Workbook (`azure-workbooks/PostgreSQL-HA-Performance-Workbook.json`) is the preferred monitoring solution

### **test-runs/**
- **Test execution logs and results**
- Load test logs from October 10, 2025
- Failover test results (CSV files from October 7, 2025)

### **test-scripts/**
- **Old test automation scripts**
- Python-based failover load test (replaced by C# LoadGenerator.csx)
- Batch and PowerShell test runners for Python tests

### **documentation/**
- **Development diaries and historical documentation**
- Build automation summaries
- Bug fix documentation
- Feature implementation notes
- Monitoring setup documentation (replaced by Azure Workbook)
- Cloud Shell guides (niche use case)
- Performance validation notes

### **utilities/**
- **Specialized utility scripts** with limited use cases
- Cloud Shell setup scripts (`.ps1` and `.sh`)
- Code indentation fixers (Python and PowerShell)
- Diagnostic utilities (`Diagnose-Failover-Performance.ps1`)

### **libs/**
- **DLL files** that were committed to the repository
- `Microsoft.Extensions.Logging.Abstractions.dll`
- `Npgsql.dll`
- **Note:** These are now downloaded automatically via NuGet when `LoadGenerator.csx` runs

### **maintenance/**
- **Repository maintenance scripts**
- `push-to-github.ps1` - Personal Git utility
- `GITHUB-RELEASE-CHECKLIST.md` - Release management checklist

## üîç Why Files Were Archived

### **Principle 1: Single Source of Truth**
Files that existed in multiple locations were consolidated. Only one canonical version remains in the active workspace.

### **Principle 2: Operational vs Historical**
Users need **operational scripts** to deploy, test, and monitor. Development diaries and implementation notes are historical artifacts.

### **Principle 3: Modern Approaches**
Newer, better approaches replaced older methods:
- **Azure Container Instances** ‚Üí Better than Azure Functions for load testing
- **LoadGenerator.csx (C#)** ‚Üí Better than Python scripts (12K+ TPS proven)
- **Monitor-LoadGenerator-Resilient.ps1** ‚Üí Better than Monitor-LoadTest.ps1 (handles Azure API failures)
- **Azure Workbook** ‚Üí Better than manual dashboard creation

### **Principle 4: Auto-Downloaded Dependencies**
DLL files committed to Git are unnecessary when package managers (NuGet) can download them automatically.

## ‚úÖ What Remains in Active Workspace

### **Core Operational Files (~35 files):**
- Infrastructure as Code (Bicep/ARM)
- Deployment scripts (Deploy-SAIF-PostgreSQL.ps1, Quick-Deploy-SAIF.ps1)
- SAIF web/API application (required for security demos)
- Database initialization (SQL scripts, Initialize-Database.ps1)
- Load testing (LoadGenerator.csx, Deploy-LoadGenerator-ACI.ps1, monitors)
- Failover testing (Test-PostgreSQL-Failover.ps1, Measure-Connection-RTO.ps1)
- Azure Workbook monitoring (PostgreSQL-HA-Performance-Workbook.json)
- Operational documentation (deployment guides, quick references, troubleshooting)

## üîÑ Restoration

If you need any archived file:

1. **Navigate to the appropriate subfolder** (e.g., `archive/documentation/`)
2. **Copy the file back** to its original location
3. **Or reference it directly** from the archive folder

**No files were deleted** - everything is preserved in this archive.

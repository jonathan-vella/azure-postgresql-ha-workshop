## Executive Summary

> **⚠️ PROOF OF CONCEPT ENVIRONMENT - NOT FOR PRODUCTION USE**
>
> **CRITICAL DISCLAIMER**: This document describes a **non-production proof of concept (PoC) environment** for evaluation and validation purposes ONLY. This accelerated PoC is **NOT intended for production deployment** or live transaction processing. Key limitations:
>
> - **No Production Data**: Do not import or process live payment data, production cardholder information, or real customer transactions
> - **Isolated Evaluation**: This PoC operates as an isolated validation environment and must remain completely separate from production systems
> - **Time-Limited**: PoC environment should be decommissioned or converted to dev/test after validation is complete
> - **Not Production-Ready**: While PCI DSS controls are demonstrated for validation, full production hardening, QSA certification, and additional security measures are required before any live deployment
> - **Compliance Status**: This PoC demonstrates compliance readiness concepts but does NOT constitute PCI DSS certification or production approval
> - **Production Path**: Successful PoC validation must be followed by a separate, dedicated production deployment with comprehensive QSA assessment, security hardening, and formal certification processes
>
> **DO NOT** use this PoC environment for live transactions, production data, or customer-facing services.

This document outlines an **accelerated delivery plan** to deploy a greenfield Azure Build-Out PoC for a **PCI DSS–compliant payment gateway** workload in **2-3 weeks**. The PoC establishes a non-production validation environment with all original deliverables and scope compressed through parallel workstreams, pre-built templates, and focused prioritization.

> **Note**: For a more detailed, sequential approach with extended time for training and knowledge transfer, see the [standard 6-week PoC plan](./azure-pci-compliant-build-poc.md).

### PoC vs Production Deployment Timeline

This critical timeline visualization shows the complete journey from PoC to Production, emphasizing that the accelerated PoC is only the **first phase** of a larger deployment process.

```

**Key Takeaway**: The PoC (Phase 1) is **NON-PRODUCTION ONLY** and must be followed by separate production planning and deployment phases (Phases 2-3) before any live transaction processing.

### Accelerated vs. Standard Timeline Comparison

| Aspect | Accelerated (2-3 Weeks) | Standard (6 Weeks) |
|--------|------------------------|-------------------|
| **Environment Type** | **NON-PRODUCTION PoC** | **NON-PRODUCTION PoC** |
| **Team Commitment** | 100% dedicated, 5.5 FTE | Partial allocation, 6-8 FTE |
| **Workstream Model** | Parallel execution from Day 1 | Sequential with some overlap |
| **Pre-Built Assets** | Required (templates, policies, reference architectures) | Helpful but not mandatory |
| **Training & Knowledge Transfer** | Minimal, assumes existing Azure expertise | Comprehensive, includes skill development |
| **Risk Tolerance** | Higher, requires experienced team | Lower, allows for learning curve |
| **Decision Velocity** | Daily steering committee, <4 hour approvals | Weekly reviews, standard approvals |
| **Ideal For** | Experienced Azure teams, urgent **validation** needs | First Azure workload, skill development focus |
| **Post-Completion** | **Decommission or convert to dev/test** | **Decommission or convert to dev/test** |

### Key Success Factors
- **Non-Production PoC Environment**: All objectives are for validation purposes only, not production deployment
- **PCI DSS v4.0 alignment** across people, process, and technology controls (demonstration of compliance readiness concepts)
- **Near-zero data loss** (Recovery Point Objective ≤ 5 seconds) with **downtime under 30 seconds** during failover events (Recovery Time Objective ≤ 30 seconds) in PoC validation environment
- **Azure-first landing zone** built according to the **Microsoft Cloud Adoption Framework (CAF)** and **Azure Well-Architected Framework (WAF)**
- Accelerated delivery through **parallel workstreams, pre-configured templates, and MVP-focused scope**
- **Clear separation** from production systems with documented decommissioning or conversion plan

## Scope and Context

### Prerequisites

Before starting this accelerated PoC, ensure the following prerequisites are met:

- **Azure Subscription**: Active Azure subscription with sufficient quota for enterprise-grade resources
- **Executive Sponsorship**: Confirmed executive sponsor and steering committee with daily availability for rapid decisions
- **Budget Approval**: Approved budget for 2-3 week accelerated PoC sprint
- **Team Availability**: Dedicated team members (5.5 FTE) with 100% allocation for the engagement period
- **Access & Permissions**: Global Admin or Owner access to Azure subscription and Microsoft Entra ID tenant
- **Compliance Requirements**: PCI DSS v4.0 documentation and QSA engagement timeline confirmed
- **Network Planning**: IP address ranges pre-allocated for Azure Virtual Networks (hub and spoke)
- **Identity Foundation**: Microsoft Entra ID tenant available for integration
- **Pre-Built Assets**: Confirmed availability of CAF templates, policy initiatives, and reference architectures
- **Skills Readiness**: Team familiar with Azure services or pre-trained on key technologies

> **⚠️ Critical Success Factor**: Unlike the standard 6-week PoC, the accelerated timeline requires immediate availability of all prerequisites and team members. Any delays in securing these items will directly impact the delivery schedule.

### Project Scope

> **⚠️ NON-PRODUCTION POC SCOPE REMINDER**
>
> This is a **validation and evaluation environment ONLY**. Do not confuse PoC completion with production readiness. A separate production deployment project is required after PoC validation.

| Dimension | Details |
|-----------|---------|
| **Environment Type** | **NON-PRODUCTION Proof of Concept for Evaluation Only** |
| Deployment Strategy | Isolated Azure PoC build, no data synchronization with production systems, no cutover to live environment. |
| Data Handling | Greenfield databases with **synthetic/test data only** - absolutely NO production data import. |
| PoC Completion Model | Validation and acceptance criteria verification only - **NOT a production go-live**. |
| Production Deployment | **Separate production deployment required** after PoC validation and QSA certification. |
| On-Premises Systems | Remain unchanged; PoC operates as isolated validation environment. |
| Landing Zone | First Azure workload; landing zone created for PoC validation purposes. |
| **Acceleration Method** | **Parallel workstreams, enterprise-scale templates, pre-built compliance baselines, and focused MVP scope.** |
| **Post-PoC Action** | Environment decommissioned or converted to dev/test after validation - **NOT promoted to production**. |

## Accelerated Delivery Strategy

### Parallel Workstreams (Weeks 1-3)

The traditional 6-week sequential plan is compressed into three parallel tracks:

| Track | Focus | Team | Parallel Execution |
|-------|-------|------|-------------------|
| **Track A: Foundation** | Landing Zone, networking, identity, governance baselines | Infrastructure Lead + Security Engineer | Weeks 1-2 |
| **Track B: Platform** | CI/CD, AKS/App Service, Key Vault, monitoring setup | Platform Engineer + DevOps Lead | Weeks 1-2 |
| **Track C: Application** | Payment microservices, PostgreSQL HA, data integration | Application Lead + Database Specialist | Weeks 1-3 |
| **Track D: Validation** | Security scanning, compliance checks, performance testing, DR drills | QA Lead + Security/Compliance Specialist | Weeks 2-3 |

### Pre-Built Assets & Reusable Templates

**Assumption**: Leverage Microsoft CAF enterprise-scale landing zone bicep templates and pre-configured PCI baseline policies to reduce build time by ~40%.

- Enterprise-scale hub-spoke topology (Bicep templates)
- PCI DSS Azure Policy initiative (baseline guardrails)
- Payment gateway reference architecture (containerized microservices)
- Pre-configured Azure Monitor alert rules and Log Analytics queries
- Runbook library for failover, backup/restore, and incident response

## Compressed Timeline: 2-3 Weeks

> **⚠️ TIMELINE DISCLAIMER**: This accelerated timeline is for **PoC validation purposes only**. Do not use this schedule as a production deployment timeline. Production deployments require additional time for comprehensive security hardening, QSA certification, load testing, and operational readiness that are beyond the scope of this PoC.

### Overall Timeline Visualization

The following Gantt chart provides a high-level view of the entire 2-3 week accelerated PoC timeline, showing how parallel workstreams enable rapid delivery. Note that this is a **non-production validation environment** with compressed timelines not suitable for production deployment.

## Risks & Mitigations (Accelerated Context)

> **⚠️ POC RISK CONTEXT**: The risks and mitigations below are specific to the **non-production PoC validation environment**. Production deployments will require additional risk assessment and mitigation strategies beyond what is described here.

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| **Compressed timeline delays foundational work** | Cascading schedule impact | Parallel workstreams; pre-built templates; daily standups; escalation to steering committee |
| **Incomplete PCI compliance evidence** | Go-live blocked | Automated evidence capture in CI/CD; compliance backlog prioritized from Day 1; QSA alignment early |
| **Performance targets not met** | Rework required | Early load modeling; staging environment mirrors production; K6 tests run daily from Week 2 |
| **Security misconfiguration in rapid deployment** | Breach risk | Continuous policy enforcement, daily Defender for Cloud reviews, SAST in every commit |
| **Skill gaps on Azure services** | Operational risk | Pre-PoC training; pair Azure specialists with on-prem SMEs; runbooks with detailed steps |
| **DR drill failures** | Runbook ineffective | Conduct drills mid-Week 3 with time for refinement; schedule second drill if needed |
| **PoC environment mistaken for production-ready** | Premature production deployment; security/compliance violations | Clear disclaimers in all documentation; separate PoC and production subscriptions; explicit decommission/conversion planning; executive steering committee reinforcement of PoC scope |
| **Production data imported into PoC** | PCI compliance violation; security breach | Strict data handling policies; synthetic data only; automated scanning for sensitive data patterns; isolated network with no production connectivity |

---

## Deliverables (Same as Full-Length PoC)

> **⚠️ POC DELIVERABLES DISCLAIMER**: All deliverables are scoped for **non-production PoC validation** purposes. These deliverables demonstrate concepts and feasibility but require significant enhancement, hardening, and validation before use in production environments. Production-ready versions of these deliverables must be developed as part of a separate production deployment project.

1. **Landing Zone Blueprint** aligned with CAF enterprise-scale architecture (Bicep templates + documentation) - **PoC validation version only**.
2. **Payment Gateway Reference Architecture** diagrams, IaC templates, and microservices codebase - **for evaluation purposes, not production deployment**.
3. **PCI DSS Control Implementation Guide** with automated evidence cataloging procedure and compliance dashboards - **demonstrates compliance readiness concepts, not full certification**.
4. **Runbooks** for deployment, failover, incident response, backup/restore, and break-glass access - **PoC validation procedures, require production hardening**.
5. **KPI Dashboard** (Power BI or Azure Monitor Workbook) tracking real-time technical and business metrics - **configured for PoC validation targets**.
6. **PoC Closeout Report** summarizing outcomes, validation results, lessons learned, and **recommendations for production deployment** - including clear separation between PoC achievements and production requirements.

## Lessons Learned & Best Practices

### What Makes Accelerated Delivery Successful

**Team Characteristics**:
- Prior Azure experience with similar workloads
- Cross-functional team with overlapping skills (reduce single points of failure)
- Co-located or highly synchronized remote team (same time zones preferred)
- Empowered to make technical decisions without lengthy approval chains

**Organizational Readiness**:
- Executive sponsorship with authority to break through blockers
- Pre-approved budget with emergency contingency
- Clear scope boundaries with "no scope creep" discipline
- Acceptance that some documentation will be completed post-deployment

**Technical Preparedness**:
- Sandbox environment for template validation before Day 1
- Reference architecture already aligned with business requirements
- Network architecture pre-approved by security team
- Third-party integrations (QSA tooling, SIEM, ticketing) APIs documented

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid

| Pitfall | Impact | Prevention Strategy |
|---------|--------|---------------------|
| **"We'll figure it out as we go"** | 2-3 day delays per decision | Pre-deployment planning session; finalize all design decisions before Day 1 |
| **Underestimating policy remediation time** | Compliance validation blocked | Test policy initiative in sandbox; remediate baseline environment Week 0 |
| **Insufficient Azure quotas** | Deployment failures on Day 1-2 | Request quota increases 1 week before start; validate approved limits |
| **Key team member unavailable** | Critical path blocked | Identify backup for each role; maintain cross-training documentation |
| **Scope expansion during execution** | Timeline slippage | "Parking lot" for future enhancements; strict change control process |
| **Inadequate testing time in Week 3** | Failed KPI validation | Perform smoke tests continuously from Week 2; don't wait for Week 3 |

### When to Choose Standard Timeline Instead

Consider the **6-week standard PoC** if any of these apply:
- Team has limited Azure experience and needs skill development
- Organization requires extensive documentation for audit trails
- Compliance evidence collection process is manual or unfamiliar
- Budget approval process requires detailed cost analysis and optimization
- Stakeholders need time to review and provide feedback at each phase
- First Azure workload; landing zone patterns need careful consideration

---

## Critical Dependencies & Constraints

### Must-Have Before Day 1

| Dependency | Requirement | Impact if Missing |
|------------|-------------|------------------|
| **Azure Subscription** | Active with elevated quotas pre-approved | Immediate deployment blocker |
| **Pre-Built Templates** | CAF landing zone Bicep templates validated | 40% schedule slip |
| **Team Availability** | 5.5 FTE committed for full 3 weeks | Cascading delays across all tracks |
| **Executive Sponsor** | Daily availability for approvals | Decision bottlenecks |
| **Network Design** | IP ranges, hub-spoke topology documented | Infrastructure track blocked |
| **Azure AD Tenant** | Configured with required licenses | Identity track blocked |
| **PCI Baseline Policies** | Azure Policy initiative ready to deploy | Compliance validation delayed |

### Success Constraints

**Time Constraints**:
- No buffer for scope changes or discovery
- Daily checkpoint meetings are mandatory, not optional
- Weekend work may be required for Week 3 validation

**Team Constraints**:
- Zero tolerance for multi-tasking; 100% focus required
- Azure expertise is mandatory; no time for on-the-job training
- Backup resources identified for each critical role

**Technical Constraints**:
- All tooling and access must be ready Day 1
- No time for proof-of-concept experimentation
- Must accept some technical debt for later optimization

## Next Steps (PoC Validation Path)

> **⚠️ CRITICAL: THESE ARE POC VALIDATION STEPS, NOT PRODUCTION DEPLOYMENT STEPS**
>
> The steps below outline the **proof of concept validation process** for a **non-production evaluation environment**. These steps do **NOT** constitute a production deployment path. After successful PoC completion, a separate production deployment project must be initiated with:
>
> - **Full QSA Assessment**: Complete PCI DSS v4.0 certification process with qualified security assessor
> - **Production Security Hardening**: Additional security controls beyond PoC scope
> - **Production Load Testing**: Comprehensive performance validation at production scale
> - **Operational Readiness**: Complete runbooks, monitoring, incident response, and on-call procedures
> - **Business Continuity**: Comprehensive DR planning and business continuity validation
> - **Regulatory Approvals**: All necessary business and regulatory approvals for live transaction processing
>
> **Never proceed directly from PoC to production without these critical steps.**

### PoC Validation Steps

1. **Secure executive sponsorship and fund 2-3 week PoC sprint** (immediate) - clearly communicate this is for **evaluation purposes only**.
2. **Confirm pre-built asset availability** (CAF templates, policy initiatives, reference architecture) - ensure all assets are marked as **PoC/evaluation templates**.
3. **Assemble and kick off 5.5 FTE team** with parallel workstream assignments - set clear expectations this is a **non-production validation environment**.
4. **Execute Week 1 landing zone and platform enablement** in parallel - deploy in **isolated PoC subscription/environment**.
5. **Daily tracking of KPIs and risk mitigation**; steering committee escalation if schedule at risk - focus on **PoC validation objectives**.
6. **Week 3 PoC validation completion** based on technical/business KPI validation and PCI readiness demonstration - **NOT a production go-live**.
7. **PoC closeout and decommission/conversion planning** - decide whether to decommission or convert to dev/test environment.

### Post-PoC: Production Deployment Planning

After successful PoC validation, initiate a **separate production deployment project** that includes:

1. **QSA Engagement**: Full PCI DSS v4.0 assessment and certification process
2. **Production Architecture Review**: Refine PoC learnings into production-grade architecture
3. **Security Hardening**: Additional controls, penetration testing, and vulnerability management
4. **Operational Readiness**: Complete monitoring, alerting, incident response, and runbook development
5. **Production Deployment**: Separate deployment to production environment with proper change management
6. **Go-Live Readiness**: Final approvals, cutover planning, and business continuity validation

## Executive Summary

This document outlines an **accelerated delivery plan** to deploy a greenfield Azure Build-Out PoC for a **PCI DSS–compliant payment gateway** workload in **2-3 weeks**. The PoC establishes a production-grade parallel environment with all original deliverables and scope compressed through parallel workstreams, pre-built templates, and focused prioritization.

> **Note**: For a more detailed, sequential approach with extended time for training and knowledge transfer, see the [standard 6-week PoC plan](./azure-pci-compliant-build-poc.md).

### Accelerated vs. Standard Timeline Comparison

| Aspect | Accelerated (2-3 Weeks) | Standard (6 Weeks) |
|--------|------------------------|-------------------|
| **Team Commitment** | 100% dedicated, 5.5 FTE | Partial allocation, 6-8 FTE |
| **Workstream Model** | Parallel execution from Day 1 | Sequential with some overlap |
| **Pre-Built Assets** | Required (templates, policies, reference architectures) | Helpful but not mandatory |
| **Training & Knowledge Transfer** | Minimal, assumes existing Azure expertise | Comprehensive, includes skill development |
| **Risk Tolerance** | Higher, requires experienced team | Lower, allows for learning curve |
| **Decision Velocity** | Daily steering committee, <4 hour approvals | Weekly reviews, standard approvals |
| **Ideal For** | Experienced Azure teams, urgent business needs | First Azure workload, skill development focus |

### Key Success Factors
- **PCI DSS v4.0 alignment** across people, process, and technology controls.
- **Near-zero data loss** (Recovery Point Objective ≤ 5 seconds) with **downtime under 30 seconds** during failover events (Recovery Time Objective ≤ 30 seconds).
- **Azure-first landing zone** built according to the **Microsoft Cloud Adoption Framework (CAF)** and **Azure Well-Architected Framework (WAF)**.
- Accelerated delivery through **parallel workstreams, pre-configured templates, and MVP-focused scope**.

## Scope and Context

### Prerequisites

Before starting this accelerated PoC, ensure the following prerequisites are met:

- **Azure Subscription**: Active Azure subscription with sufficient quota for enterprise-grade resources
- **Executive Sponsorship**: Confirmed executive sponsor and steering committee with daily availability for rapid decisions
- **Budget Approval**: Approved budget for 2-3 week accelerated PoC sprint
- **Team Availability**: Dedicated team members (5.5 FTE) with 100% allocation for the engagement period
- **Access & Permissions**: Global Admin or Owner access to Azure subscription and Microsoft Entra ID tenant
- **Compliance Requirements**: PCI DSS v4.0 documentation and QSA engagement timeline confirmed
- **Network Planning**: IP address ranges pre-allocated for Azure Virtual Networks (hub and spoke)

## Lessons Learned & Best Practices

### What Makes Accelerated Delivery Successful

**Team Characteristics**:
- Prior Azure experience with similar workloads
- Cross-functional team with overlapping skills (reduce single points of failure)
- Co-located or highly synchronized remote team (same time zones preferred)
- Empowered to make technical decisions without lengthy approval chains

**Organizational Readiness**:
- Executive sponsorship with authority to break through blockers
- Pre-approved budget with emergency contingency
- Clear scope boundaries with "no scope creep" discipline
- Acceptance that some documentation will be completed post-deployment

**Technical Preparedness**:
- Sandbox environment for template validation before Day 1
- Reference architecture already aligned with business requirements
- Network architecture pre-approved by security team
- Third-party integrations (QSA tooling, SIEM, ticketing) APIs documented

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid

| Pitfall | Impact | Prevention Strategy |
|---------|--------|---------------------|
| **"We'll figure it out as we go"** | 2-3 day delays per decision | Pre-deployment planning session; finalize all design decisions before Day 1 |
| **Underestimating policy remediation time** | Compliance validation blocked | Test policy initiative in sandbox; remediate baseline environment Week 0 |
| **Insufficient Azure quotas** | Deployment failures on Day 1-2 | Request quota increases 1 week before start; validate approved limits |
| **Key team member unavailable** | Critical path blocked | Identify backup for each role; maintain cross-training documentation |
| **Scope expansion during execution** | Timeline slippage | "Parking lot" for future enhancements; strict change control process |
| **Inadequate testing time in Week 3** | Failed KPI validation | Perform smoke tests continuously from Week 2; don't wait for Week 3 |

### When to Choose Standard Timeline Instead

Consider the **6-week standard PoC** if any of these apply:
- Team has limited Azure experience and needs skill development
- Organization requires extensive documentation for audit trails
- Compliance evidence collection process is manual or unfamiliar
- Budget approval process requires detailed cost analysis and optimization
- Stakeholders need time to review and provide feedback at each phase
- First Azure workload; landing zone patterns need careful consideration

---

## Critical Dependencies & Constraints

### Must-Have Before Day 1

| Dependency | Requirement | Impact if Missing |
|------------|-------------|------------------|
| **Azure Subscription** | Active with elevated quotas pre-approved | Immediate deployment blocker |
| **Pre-Built Templates** | CAF landing zone Bicep templates validated | 40% schedule slip |
| **Team Availability** | 5.5 FTE committed for full 3 weeks | Cascading delays across all tracks |
| **Executive Sponsor** | Daily availability for approvals | Decision bottlenecks |
| **Network Design** | IP ranges, hub-spoke topology documented | Infrastructure track blocked |
| **Azure AD Tenant** | Configured with required licenses | Identity track blocked |
| **PCI Baseline Policies** | Azure Policy initiative ready to deploy | Compliance validation delayed |

### Success Constraints

**Time Constraints**:
- No buffer for scope changes or discovery
- Daily checkpoint meetings are mandatory, not optional
- Weekend work may be required for Week 3 validation

**Team Constraints**:
- Zero tolerance for multi-tasking; 100% focus required
- Azure expertise is mandatory; no time for on-the-job training
- Backup resources identified for each critical role

**Technical Constraints**:
- All tooling and access must be ready Day 1
- No time for proof-of-concept experimentation
- Must accept some technical debt for later optimization

---

## Next Steps (Go-Live Path)

1. **Secure executive sponsorship and fund 2-3 week PoC sprint** (immediate).
2. **Confirm pre-built asset availability** (CAF templates, policy initiatives, reference architecture).
3. **Assemble and kick off 5.5 FTE team** with parallel workstream assignments.
4. **Execute Week 1 landing zone and platform enablement** in parallel.
5. **Daily tracking of KPIs and risk mitigation**; steering committee escalation if schedule at risk.
6. **Week 3 go-live approval** based on technical/business KPI validation and PCI readiness.
7. **Schedule production deployment window** and finalize on-call support model.

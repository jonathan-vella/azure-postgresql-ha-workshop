## Executive Summary

> **⚠️ PROOF OF CONCEPT ENVIRONMENT - NOT FOR PRODUCTION USE**

This document outlines the plan to deliver a greenfield Azure Build-Out **Proof of Concept (PoC)** for a **PCI DSS–compliant payment gateway** workload. This PoC establishes a **non-production evaluation environment** that demonstrates technical feasibility and validates architecture decisions independently from existing systems. The environment is designed to meet stringent validation objectives:

- **PCI DSS v4.0 alignment** across people, process, and technology controls (demonstration of compliance readiness, not certification)
- **Near-zero data loss** (Recovery Point Objective ≤ 5 seconds) with **downtime under 30 seconds** during failover events (Recovery Time Objective ≤ 30 seconds)
- **Azure-first landing zone** built according to the **Microsoft Cloud Adoption Framework (CAF)** and **Azure Well-Architected Framework (WAF)**
- Clear set of **technical and business KPIs** to prove success and inform the eventual production rollout
- **Time-limited deployment** for validation only, with planned decommissioning after PoC completion

### Key Success Factors

| Factor | Target |
|--------|--------|
| **Timeline** | 6 weeks (Week 0 through Week 6) |
| **Deployment Model** | Greenfield PoC environment (non-production) |
| **Compliance** | PCI DSS v4.0 compliance readiness demonstration |
| **Availability** | 99.95%+ uptime (PoC validation target) |
| **Performance** | ≥1,500 TPS with P99 latency ≤200ms (PoC validation target) |
| **Environment Status** | **NON-PRODUCTION - Evaluation Only** |

> **Note**: For an accelerated 2-3 week delivery option, see [azure-pci-compliant-build-poc-accelerated.md](./azure-pci-compliant-build-poc-accelerated.md)

## Scope and Context

### Project Scope

| Dimension | Details |
|-----------|---------|
| **Environment Type** | **NON-PRODUCTION Proof of Concept** |
| **Deployment Strategy** | Isolated Azure PoC build, no data synchronization with production systems, no cutover |
| **Data Handling** | Greenfield databases with **synthetic/test data only** - NO production data |
| **PoC Completion Model** | Validation and acceptance criteria verification only - **NOT a production go-live** |
| **Production Deployment** | Separate production deployment required after PoC validation and QSA certification |
| **On-Premises Systems** | Remain unchanged; PoC operates as isolated validation environment |
| **Landing Zone** | First Azure workload; landing zone created for PoC validation purposes |
| **Duration** | 6 weeks (includes planning, deployment, testing, knowledge transfer, and decommission planning) |
| **Team Size** | 6-8 FTE (Infrastructure, Security, Platform, Application, Database, QA) |
| **Post-PoC Action** | Environment decommissioned or converted to dev/test after validation |

- **Continuous Compliance**: Shift from point-in-time to continuous monitoring and validation
- **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**: Expanded requirements for MFA across all access types
- **Enhanced Password Requirements**: Stronger password policies and secure storage
- **Encryption and Key Management**: Updated cryptographic requirements
- **Regular Security Assessments**: More frequent testing and validation cycles

## Resiliency & Data Protection Strategy

### High Availability Design

The architecture is designed to meet aggressive RTO and RPO targets through multiple layers of redundancy:

- **Database HA**: PostgreSQL Flexible Server with zone-redundant HA, synchronous replication, and geo-redundant backups (RA-GRS) to achieve **RPO ≤ 5s**
  - Synchronous replication between availability zones (RPO = 0 for zone failures)
  - Automatic failover with RTO target of 60-120 seconds
  - Hot standby replica ready for immediate promotion
  - Continuous health monitoring and automatic failure detection

- **Application HA**: Multi-region deployment with Traffic Manager or Front Door for failover routing, health probes every 5 seconds
  - Active-passive configuration with automatic failover
  - Health endpoint monitoring with configurable thresholds
  - Deployment slots for zero-downtime deployments
  - Session affinity and state management via Redis or Cosmos DB

- **Network Redundancy**: Zone-redundant Application Gateway and Azure Firewall
  - Multiple gateway instances across availability zones
  - Automatic rerouting during zone failures
  - DDoS Protection Standard for attack mitigation

### Backup & Recovery Strategy

Comprehensive backup strategy to ensure data durability and compliance:

- **Database Backups**:
  - Automated daily full backups with 7-day retention (configurable up to 35 days)
  - Transaction log backups every 5 minutes
  - Geo-redundant backup storage (RA-GRS) for disaster recovery
  - Point-in-time restore capability within retention period
  
- **Backup Validation**:
  - Monthly restore validation tests to staging environment
  - Documented restore procedures and runbooks
  - Backup success rate monitoring (target: 100%)
  
- **Audit Log Retention**:
  - Immutable blob storage for audit logs with 7-year retention
  - WORM (Write Once, Read Many) policy enforcement
  - Continuous export from Log Analytics to storage account

### Disaster Recovery (DR)

Structured DR strategy with tested procedures:

- **Failover Orchestration**: Automated failover orchestration via Azure Automation runbooks, targeted **RTO ≤ 30s** for primary database and application endpoints
  - Pre-validated runbooks for database failover
  - Automated DNS updates and traffic routing
  - Application configuration updates via Key Vault references
  
- **DR Drills**: Quarterly full DR drills to validate procedures and measure actual RTO/RPO
  - Scheduled failover tests in maintenance windows
  - Documented results and lessons learned
  - Continuous improvement of automation scripts
  
- **Recovery Scenarios**:
  - Zone failure: Automatic failover to standby zone (RTO ≤ 2 minutes)
  - Region failure: Manual failover to secondary region (RTO ≤ 30 minutes)
  - Data corruption: Point-in-time restore from backups (RTO ≤ 4 hours)

### Monitoring & Alerting for Resiliency

Real-time monitoring to ensure SLA compliance:

- PostgreSQL replication lag monitoring (alert threshold: >3 seconds)
- Application health endpoint synthetic monitoring (1-minute intervals)
- Backup job success/failure notifications
- Failover event logging and notification
- Azure Service Health alerts for platform issues

## Deployment & Operations Plan

### ⚠️ PROOF OF CONCEPT DISCLAIMER

> **IMPORTANT**: This is a Proof of Concept (PoC) environment designed for **evaluation and validation purposes only**. This deployment is **NOT intended for production use** or live transaction processing. Key considerations:
>
> - **No Production Data**: Do not import or process live payment data or production cardholder information
> - **Isolated Environment**: This PoC operates independently and should remain isolated from production systems
> - **Time-Limited**: PoC environment should be decommissioned after validation is complete
> - **Security Posture**: While PCI DSS controls are implemented for validation, full production hardening and certification require additional steps
> - **Compliance Status**: This PoC demonstrates compliance readiness but does not constitute PCI DSS certification
> - **Next Steps**: Successful PoC validation should lead to a separate production deployment with full QSA assessment
>
> For production deployment planning, engage with your QSA and review production hardening requirements beyond this PoC scope.

### 6-Week Implementation Timeline

The deployment follows a phased approach with clear milestones and deliverables. Each phase includes validation gates before proceeding to the next.

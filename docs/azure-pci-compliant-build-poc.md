## Resiliency & Data Protection Strategy

### High Availability Design

The architecture is designed to meet aggressive RTO and RPO targets through multiple layers of redundancy:

- **Database HA**: PostgreSQL Flexible Server with zone-redundant HA, synchronous replication, and geo-redundant backups (RA-GRS) to achieve **RPO ≤ 5s**
  - Synchronous replication between availability zones (RPO = 0 for zone failures)
  - Automatic failover with RTO target of 60-120 seconds
  - Hot standby replica ready for immediate promotion
  - Continuous health monitoring and automatic failure detection

- **Application HA**: Multi-region deployment with Traffic Manager or Front Door for failover routing, health probes every 5 seconds
  - Active-passive configuration with automatic failover
  - Health endpoint monitoring with configurable thresholds
  - Deployment slots for zero-downtime deployments
  - Session affinity and state management via Redis or Cosmos DB

- **Network Redundancy**: Zone-redundant Application Gateway and Azure Firewall
  - Multiple gateway instances across availability zones
  - Automatic rerouting during zone failures
  - DDoS Protection Standard for attack mitigation

### Backup & Recovery Strategy

Comprehensive backup strategy to ensure data durability and compliance:

- **Database Backups**:
  - Automated daily full backups with 7-day retention (configurable up to 35 days)
  - Transaction log backups every 5 minutes
  - Geo-redundant backup storage (RA-GRS) for disaster recovery
  - Point-in-time restore capability within retention period
  
- **Backup Validation**:
  - Monthly restore validation tests to staging environment
  - Documented restore procedures and runbooks
  - Backup success rate monitoring (target: 100%)
  
- **Audit Log Retention**:
  - Immutable blob storage for audit logs with 7-year retention
  - WORM (Write Once, Read Many) policy enforcement
  - Continuous export from Log Analytics to storage account

### Disaster Recovery (DR)

Structured DR strategy with tested procedures:

- **Failover Orchestration**: Automated failover orchestration via Azure Automation runbooks, targeted **RTO ≤ 30s** for primary database and application endpoints
  - Pre-validated runbooks for database failover
  - Automated DNS updates and traffic routing
  - Application configuration updates via Key Vault references
  
- **DR Drills**: Quarterly full DR drills to validate procedures and measure actual RTO/RPO
  - Scheduled failover tests in maintenance windows
  - Documented results and lessons learned
  - Continuous improvement of automation scripts
  
- **Recovery Scenarios**:
  - Zone failure: Automatic failover to standby zone (RTO ≤ 2 minutes)
  - Region failure: Manual failover to secondary region (RTO ≤ 30 minutes)
  - Data corruption: Point-in-time restore from backups (RTO ≤ 4 hours)

### Monitoring & Alerting for Resiliency

Real-time monitoring to ensure SLA compliance:

- PostgreSQL replication lag monitoring (alert threshold: >3 seconds)
- Application health endpoint synthetic monitoring (1-minute intervals)
- Backup job success/failure notifications
- Failover event logging and notification
- Azure Service Health alerts for platform issues

# Azure PCI-Compliant Build Proof of Concept (PoC)

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the plan to deliver a greenfield Azure Build-Out PoC for a **PCI DSS–compliant payment gateway** workload. The PoC establishes a production-grade parallel environment that operates independently from the existing on-premises system while meeting stringent objectives:

- **PCI DSS v4.0 alignment** across people, process, and technology controls.
- **Near-zero data loss** (Recovery Point Objective ≤ 5 seconds) with **downtime under 30 seconds** during failover events (Recovery Time Objective ≤ 30 seconds).
- **Azure-first landing zone** built according to the **Microsoft Cloud Adoption Framework (CAF)** and **Azure Well-Architected Framework (WAF)**.
- Clear set of **technical and business KPIs** to prove success and inform the eventual production rollout.

## Scope and Context

| Dimension | Details |
|-----------|---------|
| Deployment Strategy | Parallel Azure build, no data synchronization with on-premises, no cutover. |
| Data Handling | Greenfield databases; no seed data import. |
| Go-Live Model | Full workload go-live when PoC acceptance criteria are met. |
| On-Premises Future | On-premises remains in production as an independent platform. |
| Landing Zone | First Azure workload; landing zone must be created during this engagement. |

## Alignment with Microsoft Cloud Adoption Framework

| CAF Phase | PoC Focus |
|-----------|-----------|
| **Strategy** | Define business outcomes (fraud reduction, payment authorization SLAs, regional expansion) and establish executive sponsorship. |
| **Plan** | Build a prioritized backlog covering payment gateway services, compliance controls, networking, observability, and automation. Map skills and staffing requirements for security, networking, and operations teams. |
| **Ready** | Stand up an enterprise-scale landing zone including identity, management, security, and networking baselines (Hub-Spoke / Virtual WAN). Integrate Azure Policy for PCI guardrails. |
| **Adopt (Innovate)** | Deploy the payment gateway reference architecture using Infrastructure as Code, platform services, and automated CI/CD. |
| **Govern** | Establish policy-driven governance aligned with PCI DSS requirements and CAF governance disciplines (Cost, Security, Resource Consistency, Identity Baseline, Deployment Acceleration). |
| **Manage** | Implement operational baselines: Azure Monitor, Microsoft Sentinel, Defender for Cloud, and ITSM integration for incident/alert handling. |

## Alignment with Azure Well-Architected Framework

| Pillar | PoC Considerations |
|--------|-------------------|
| **Reliability** | Multi-region active/standby architecture, zone-redundant database tier, geo-redundant backups, automated failover runbooks, synthetic monitoring. |
| **Security** | Zero Trust principles, managed identities, Azure Firewall + WAF, Key Vault for secrets, confidential computing when applicable, continuous compliance scanning. |
| **Cost Optimization** | Right-size compute tiers (reserved capacity evaluation), leverage Azure Savings Plans, cost guardrails via budgets and alerts. |
| **Operational Excellence** | GitOps/CI-CD, Infrastructure as Code (Bicep/Terraform), automated compliance checks, runbook library for failover and break-glass scenarios. |
| **Performance Efficiency** | Autoscaling App Service/AKS tiers, caching with Azure Cache for Redis, Application Gateway with WAF autoscaling, load testing to ensure sub-200ms P99 response. |

## Target Architecture Overview

1. **Network**: Hub-Spoke topology with Azure Firewall, DDoS Protection Standard, and Private Link endpoints for all data services.
2. **Identity**: Azure AD (Entra ID) with Conditional Access, Privileged Identity Management, and integration with Azure AD B2C for customer-facing flows.
3. **Application Tier**: Containerized microservices hosted on Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) or Azure App Service with deployment slots for blue/green releases. Application Gateway (WAF v2) terminates TLS and routes to service mesh.
4. **Data Tier**: Azure Database for PostgreSQL Flexible Server (Zone-redundant HA), Azure Cosmos DB for session/state, Azure Storage with immutable blobs for audit logs.
5. **Integration**: Event-driven processing via Azure Service Bus and Event Grid to support payment events, reconciliation, and fraud analytics.
6. **Observability**: Azure Monitor, Application Insights, Log Analytics, and Azure Dashboard/Workbooks for real-time RTO/RPO metrics.
7. **Security & Compliance**: Azure Policy for PCI guardrails, Microsoft Defender for Cloud, Sentinel analytics, and integration with third-party QSA tooling.

## PCI DSS Control Mapping (Highlights)

| PCI Domain | Azure Implementation |
|------------|----------------------|
| Network Security | Azure Firewall, NSGs, Application Gateway WAF, Private Link, DDoS Protection Standard. |
| Data Protection | Always Encrypted, TDE for databases, Key Vault HSM-backed keys, confidential VM/AKS nodes, immutable storage for logs. |
| Access Control | Azure AD Conditional Access, MFA, Privileged Identity Management, Just-in-Time VM access, managed identities. |
| Monitoring & Logging | Azure Policy enforcement, Defender for Cloud alerts, Sentinel correlation, Log Analytics with 365-day retention, continuous export to immutable storage. |
| Vulnerability Management | Microsoft Defender for Cloud TVM, Azure Automation patch orchestration, container image scanning via ACR/Defender. |
| Incident Response | Sentinel playbooks (Logic Apps), runbooks for payment fraud investigations, integration with SIEM/SOAR and ticketing tools. |

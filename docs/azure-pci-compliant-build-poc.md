# Azure PCI Compliant Build POC

## Overview
This document outlines the comprehensive plan for implementing an Azure PCI compliant build, incorporating improvements based on recent recommendations.

## Risk Prioritization Matrix
- **High Risk**: Critical vulnerabilities that could lead to significant data breaches.
- **Medium Risk**: Potential threats that could impact operations but are manageable with existing controls.
- **Low Risk**: Issues with minimal impact that require monitoring but no immediate action.

## Data Migration Strategy
1. Assess current data landscape.
2. Plan migration in phases to minimize downtime.
3. Validate data integrity post-migration.

## Cost Estimation Details
- **Infrastructure Costs**: Estimate based on Azure services used.
- **Operational Costs**: Include ongoing support and maintenance.
- **Training Costs**: Factor in costs for upskilling staff.

## Rollback Criteria
- Define specific metrics that trigger a rollback (e.g., critical failure rates exceeding 5%).

## Enhanced Security Governance
- Implement multi-layer security controls.
- Regular audits and assessments to ensure compliance.

## Skills/Training Plan
- Identify skill gaps among team members.
- Develop a training program to address these gaps.

## Phase Acceptance Criteria
- Each phase must meet predefined success metrics.

## Multi-Region Specifics
- Plan for data residency and compliance in multiple regions.

## Compliance Evidence Repository
- Maintain a repository for all compliance documentation and evidence.

## Load Testing Assumptions
- Define expected load and performance metrics.

## Expanded Observability Section
- Incorporate logging and monitoring best practices.
- Use Azure Monitor and Application Insights.

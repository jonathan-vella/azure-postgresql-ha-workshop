## [Unreleased]

### Fixed
- **C# Script Worker Recovery**: Fixed workers getting stuck at 0 TPS after connection errors in `Test-PostgreSQL-Failover.csx`

  - Automatic dependency installation to `scripts/libs/` folder
  - Real-time RTO/RPO measurement with millisecond precision
  - Connection loss detection and recovery validation
  - Graceful fallback to Docker if Npgsql unavailable
- **Database Folder**: Created `database/` directory to organize SQL initialization scripts
  - `init-db.sql` - Complete schema initialization with test data functions
  - `cleanup-db.sql` - Database cleanup and reset procedures
  - `enable-uuid.sql` - UUID extension enablement
  - `README.md` - Comprehensive database documentation
- **Scripts Organization**: Implemented organized structure for deployment automation
  - `scripts/archive/` - Historical failover test iterations (7 scripts)
  - `scripts/utils/` - Diagnostic utilities (2 scripts)
  - Reduced active scripts from 16 to 8 production-ready scripts
  - Added comprehensive README.md files for each folder
- **Documentation Organization**: Restructured documentation for better navigation
  - `docs/guides/` - Operational guides (4 guides)
  - Updated `docs/README.md` with improved navigation
  - Fixed formatting and links throughout documentation
- **Repository Maintenance Files**:
  - `.gitignore` - Comprehensive ignore patterns for build artifacts, secrets, test results, and IDE files
  - `CHANGELOG.md` - This file, documenting all changes

### Changed
- **Renamed Scripts**:
  - `Test-PostgreSQL-Failover-Native.ps1` â†’ `Test-PostgreSQL-Failover.ps1` (now the primary failover testing script)
  - `Initialize-Database-Container.ps1` â†’ `Initialize-Database.ps1` (updated in documentation)
- **Performance Improvements**:
  - Failover RTO reduced from 60-120 seconds (spec) to 16-18 seconds (measured)
  - Load testing throughput increased from 0.7 TPS (Docker) to 12-13 TPS (Npgsql)
  - RPO maintained at 0 seconds (zero data loss)
- **Documentation Updates**:
  - Updated `README.md` with current script names, folder structure, and performance benchmarks
  - Updated `docs/v1.0.0/failover-testing-guide.md` with Npgsql prerequisites and performance data
  - Updated `docs/guides/container-initialization-guide.md` references
  - Fixed all broken links to reflect new `docs/guides/` structure

### Deprecated
- **Docker-based Failover Testing**: While still available as fallback, native Npgsql approach is now recommended
  - Docker method: ~0.7 TPS (container spin-up overhead)
  - Npgsql method: ~12-13 TPS (16x improvement)

### Removed
- **Obsolete Scripts** (moved to `scripts/archive/`):
  - `Test-PostgreSQL-Failover-Docker.ps1` - Original Docker-based implementation (0.7 TPS)
  - `Test-PostgreSQL-Failover-Parallel.ps1` - Parallel Docker jobs approach (5-10 TPS)
  - `Test-PostgreSQL-Failover-Fast.ps1` - Optimized Docker approach (10-20 TPS)
  - `Test-PostgreSQL-Failover-NativeDirect.ps1` - Early Npgsql iteration
  - `Update-LoadTestFunction.ps1` - Database function deployment (one-time use)
  - `Build-SAIF-Containers-Quick-Ref.ps1` - Consolidated into main build script
  - `deploy-saif-manual.ps1` - Replaced by `Deploy-SAIF.ps1`
- **Build Artifacts**:
  - `web-deploy.zip` - Removed from repository (should not be version controlled)
- **Root-level SQL Files**: Moved to `database/` folder for better organization
  - `init-db.sql` â†’ `database/init-db.sql`
  - `cleanup-db.sql` â†’ `database/cleanup-db.sql`
  - `enable-uuid.sql` â†’ `database/enable-uuid.sql`

### Fixed
- **Database Function Bug**: Added parameterless `create_test_transaction()` overload to support automated testing
  - Original function required parameters: `create_test_transaction(num_transactions, initial_id)`
  - New overload: `create_test_transaction()` - Generates single transaction with auto-generated ID
  - Deployed via `Update-LoadTestFunction.ps1` (now archived)
- **Npgsql Dependency Loading**: Resolved missing `Microsoft.Extensions.Logging.Abstractions` assembly
  - Implemented automatic NuGet package download using `dotnet build`
  - Dependencies stored in `scripts/libs/` folder (Git-ignored)
  - Eliminates manual dependency installation requirements

### Performance Metrics
- **Load Testing Throughput**: 
  - Docker: 0.7 TPS
  - PowerShell + Npgsql: 12-13 TPS (1,614% improvement)
  - **C# + Cloud Shell: 200-500 TPS** (28,571% improvement) ðŸš€
- **Failover RTO**: 16-18 seconds (measured) vs 60-120 seconds (documented spec)
- **Failover RPO**: 0 seconds (zero data loss, validated)
- **Connection Recovery**: Sub-second reconnection after failover completion
- **Network Latency**: Cloud Shell to Azure PostgreSQL: 1-5ms (vs 50-100ms from local PC)

### Technical Debt
- PowerShell loop overhead limits Npgsql performance to 12-13 TPS
  - For higher throughput (100+ TPS), consider:
    - C# console application with parallel tasks
    - .NET Worker Service with background queues
    - Load testing tools like k6, JMeter, or Apache Bench
